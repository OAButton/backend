**Checklist (For internal use)**

- [ ] Take a breath. Bugs are okay.

Preemptive communications (for high profile bugs):
- [ ] Put up a site / page banner (if warrented)
- [ ] Put up a tweet (if warrented)
- [ ] Put up announcement on Uptimerobot (if warrented)
- [ ] Set reminder to keep users up to date

User communications checklist:
- [ ] Apologize and empathize. e.g I'm so sorry. This must be such a pain.
- [ ] Give a timeline. We'll review this by X. We're working on this ASAP. 
- [ ] Confirm understanding of the issue, and request any information required.
- [ ] Thank them for letting us know. 
- [ ] Can we mitigate without fixing the bug?

Process checklist:
- [ ] Do we want a `fast` fix or a `good` fix. A good fix likely involves discussion, but may be slower. A fast fix means we fix the problem immediately without consideration for the `right` fix.
- [ ] Discussion of solution. Remember, our intutative fixs may be different (e.g UI centric, backend centric)

Post-fix
- [ ] How can we avoid bugs like this in future?
- [ ] How can we avoid regressions (e.g automated test)
