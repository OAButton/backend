# How to Contribute

Hi friend! Thanks so much for taking an interest in our work <3. 

Before you contribute, know this:

* We ask you follow our code of conduct: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6F2ePkXJWPbPcjNQstDnWP5QZsdsb4QhPR4jOGQ6SI/edit. 
* This is an open source (MIT licence) project. Your contribution will be licenced as such. 
* We try and openly document as much as possible. You might want to check our readme and issues before you contribute.

For anything else, don't be afraid to ask. Simply start an issue and hopefully it won't be too long till someone says hello and gets back to you about your question, bug, feature or idea!
