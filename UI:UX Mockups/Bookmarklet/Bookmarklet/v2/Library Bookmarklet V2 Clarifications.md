#Â Library Bookmarklet V2 Clarifications

## File 1

This page shows what happens if we find an article via the library.

* A.1: The button here can signal that it was found via the library, link through to the article or even signal where in the library a article was.

* B.1,2,3: Actual copy / designs here may vary. The important piece to know here is that where articles aren't found or the user opens it on the wrong side it's possible to flag this to a user.

## File 2

This page shows what happens if we find the article via a self archived source or if another user has already made an open access request for it. In both cases, we provide a way to start an ILL request (see E)

* The middle header here should read "Requesting article via ILL"
* C.2: This text is intended to inform authors they're going to see a self archived version. In discussions with the ILL team this was flagged as something authors won't always accept. If authors would prefer the published version, they can click through to make an ILL request.

## File 3

This design shows what users will probably see most often. This is where the article isn't available by any source. This is shown in panel one, with a call to action to make a request.

* Panels 1 & 2 could be combined (so that the text box was instantly available without needing to click)
* The submit button here would start an ILL & a request to the author together.
* The submit button we actually use has feedback to users on how good their story is (via a simple word counter) and only lets them submit once they've entered 5 words.
* The box to put in a story tells the user why they need to do this & that it'll go to the author.
* The final page is simply to confirm submission. All text is editable, and this isn't intended as final copy.
