# Bugs & User support

Bugs & user support needs can get reported via:
* the help box available on some high value pages
* Twitter (input from here should go into Github or forwarded to help@openaccessbutton.org for tracking)
* Bug form
* Github issues
* In person (input from here should go into Github or forwarded to help@openaccessbutton.org for tracking)
* During user testing (input from here should go into Github or forwarded to help@openaccessbutton.org for tracking)

In each case, the first step is to thank a user & let them know we're looking at it (or provide a fix). The final step should be to close the issue / ticket on Github / Zendesk.

## General email from a librarian

* Point person: Chealyse

## Anything other than these

* Attempt to gain enough information to replicate (e.g. Browser, how the evoke the bug, if the error is still happening) and report on Github.
* If a new type of issue, reported by more than one person, and around a new release, assume bug & move to Github.
