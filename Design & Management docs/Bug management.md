# Bugs & User support

Bugs & user support needs can get reported via:
* the help box available on some high value pages
* Twitter (input from here should go into Github or forwarded to help@openaccessbutton.org for tracking)
* Bug form (this is automatically forwarded to Github)
* Github issues
* In person (input from here should go into Github or forwarded to help@openaccessbutton.org for tracking)
* During user testing (input from here should go into Github or forwarded to help@openaccessbutton.org for tracking)

Managing all this can get complex. However, the goal is simple, provide ANY response (even thanks or an acknowledgement) within 24 hours. Then, work as soon as possible to address the issue fully.

We have systems to help manage it. Github, which is documented in the Readme, and Zendesk, described here.

#  Zendesk Management

* Sarah play's the role of "wrangler". Her role is to know the system & keep us honest with getting things closed. She has the full right to bug everyone and jump on anything.

Some lingo for Zenhub:
* Ticket: The equivalent of an issue
* Pending: The status of a ticket when we're waiting on a user, or our team for anything.
* Closed: A ticket where no furthur action can be taken (ideally, a user is happy at this point).
* Assignments: The point person on a ticket. They're expected to do whatever it takes to close the ticket.
* Internal messages: A way for us to communicate "internally" about a ticket

*Important*: You need to login to Zendesk to use it effectively. Use email messages only as notifications.  
*Important*: Assuming any message you send in relation to a ticket may be made public. Screw ups are easy, and costly if we don't follow this rule (not, this is a good general life rule too).

## Anything other than these

* Attempt to gain enough information to replicate (e.g. Browser, how the evoke the bug, if the error is still happening) and report on Github.
* If a new type of issue, reported by more than one person, and around a new release, assume bug & move to Github.
